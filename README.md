OnePlace is an iOS Swift app used in lieu of: News Stand + Google Drive + Dropbox + Photos
In New York City, spending time underground commuting makes managing files normally found online (cloud) difficult. With this app you can download directly to your phone. The app serves as a file directory that is easy to use and navigate, and allows you to view PDFs and pictures. Integrated into Dropbox, email, and Google Drive
